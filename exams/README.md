**Text of the exam:** [PDF](./written-examination-2021-01-29.pdf)

**Solutions:**
* Section 1 (theory):
  1. divide and conquer, dynamic programming
     
  2. -7
     
  3. [Solution](https://comp-think.github.io/exercises/development/beginner/exercise-17) available online.
  
  4. A Turing Machine is composed of an **infinite memory tape** containing cells. Each cell can contain a symbol (i.e. either 0 or 1, where 0 is the blank symbol, assigned to all the cells in advance) that can be read and written by the **head of the machine**. The **state of the machine at a specific time is recorded**. The machine specifies the possible actions to perform in a **finite table of instructions**. Each instruction in the table says what to do: write a new symbol, move the head either left or right, go to a new state. The machine selects a particular instruction to execute according to the current state and the symbol currently under the head. An **initial state and zero or more final states** are provided, to define where to start the process, and when to finish it.

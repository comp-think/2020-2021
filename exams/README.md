## 17 May 2021 written examination

**Text of the exam:** [PDF](./written-examination-2021-05-17.pdf)

**Solutions:**
* Section 1 (theory):
  1. In Python, a list is a mutable object, The recursive-step is one of the main step of backtracking
     
  2. `[]`
     
  3. [Solution](https://comp-think.github.io/exercises/development/beginner/exercise-19) available online.
  
  4. There are two characteristics that a computational problem should show to be sure that the application of a greedy approach will bring to an optimal solution to the problem:
     * greedy choice property – at a particular step, we can choose the best candidate for improving the set of candidates bringing to a solution;
     * optimal substructure – the optimal solution to a computational problem is built by considering the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

* Section 2 (understanding): [Solution](https://comp-think.github.io/exercises/understanding/advanced/exercise-22) available online.

* Section 3 (development): [Solution](https://comp-think.github.io/exercises/development/advanced/exercise-22) available online.


## 15 March 2021 written examination

**Text of the exam:** [PDF](./written-examination-2021-03-15.pdf)

**Solutions:**
* Section 1 (theory):
  1. The Fibonacci number can be computed using a dynamic programming approach, The Fibonacci number can be computed using a non-recursive approach
     
  2. `input_list_len == 0` should be `input_list_len <= 1`, `left = merge_sort(input_list[input_list_len:mid])` should be `left = merge_sort(input_list[0:mid])`
     
  3. [Solution](https://comp-think.github.io/exercises/development/beginner/exercise-18) available online.
  
  4. Charles Babbage developed two machines: the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine. The Difference Engine was a mechanical calculator which aimed at addressing similar tasks that were run by human computers, but in a way that was automatic, faster, and error-free. The Difference Engine was not a programmable machine since it was able to compute only a fixed set of operations on the inputs specified physically by changing specific configurations of the machine. Instead, the Analytical Engine was a programmable machine since it enabled a user could create any possible procedural calculation.

* Section 3 (development): [Solution](https://comp-think.github.io/exercises/development/advanced/exercise-21) available online.


## 29 January 2021 written examination

**Text of the exam:** [PDF](./written-examination-2021-01-29.pdf)

**Solutions:**
* Section 1 (theory):
  1. divide and conquer, dynamic programming
     
  2. -7
     
  3. [Solution](https://comp-think.github.io/exercises/development/beginner/exercise-17) available online.
  
  4. A Turing Machine is composed of an **infinite memory tape** containing cells. Each cell can contain a symbol (i.e. either 0 or 1, where 0 is the blank symbol, assigned to all the cells in advance) that can be read and written by the **head of the machine**. The **state of the machine at a specific time is recorded**. The machine specifies the possible actions to perform in a **finite table of instructions**. Each instruction in the table says what to do: write a new symbol, move the head either left or right, go to a new state. The machine selects a particular instruction to execute according to the current state and the symbol currently under the head. An **initial state and zero or more final states** are provided, to define where to start the process, and when to finish it.

* Section 3 (development): [Solution](https://comp-think.github.io/exercises/development/advanced/exercise-20) available online.
